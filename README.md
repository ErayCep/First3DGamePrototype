# First3DGamePrototype
This is my first 3D game prototype. There is not really much going on in the project but I wanted to see the programming in 3D. So here we go.

Main game type i wanted to try is diablo-like games. Topdown camera and fast hackandslash type gameplay. 

There is nothing special about project but it was a nice experience for my Unity3D knowledge
